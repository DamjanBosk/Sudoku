## App Description
The application is a classic Sudoku game, a number puzzle that features a grid of 9 regions (squares), each containing 9 smaller squares. The objective of the game is to fill in all the small squares with numbers from one to nine in a manner that prevents the repetition of the same number in any row, column, or region.

The game offers two distinct modes and three varying difficulty levels. Players can choose to play untimed, with only the total time taken to complete the game displayed or opt for a timed mode with a predefined duration for a more challenging experience.
